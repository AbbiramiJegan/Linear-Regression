# Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion using Linear Regression

This Git repository provides a comprehensive solution for converting Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius using a linear regression model. The main Jupyter notebook, `linear-regression-using-fa.ipynb`, covers data generation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and prediction.

## File:

- **linear-regression-using-fa.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook implementing the entire process, from data generation to predicting Celsius values using a linear regression model.

## Instructions:

1. Run `linear-regression-using-fa.ipynb` to explore both the direct computation of Celsius values and the advanced approach involving a linear regression model.
2. The notebook includes data generation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and predicting new Celsius values using the trained model.

## Dependencies:

- The code uses Python 3 and requires libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. Ensure you have these installed before running the notebook.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbbiramiJegan/Linear-Regression.git
   ```


3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook, `linear-regression-using-fa.ipynb`, using a tool like JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.

Feel free to experiment, modify the code, and extend the functionality as needed. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please create an issue or submit a pull request.

Enjoy converting temperatures!
